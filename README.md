# About me <a name="about"></a>

Hi, I'm Ross! <br/>

A djðŸŽ§ and scuba instructor ðŸ¤¿ turned software engineer. I have 15+ years experience across music and podcasting, events and sales, all underlined by my focus on users and details. I'm passionate about iOS dev, UX and A11Y. Want to talk? Send me a message - I'm always looking to collaborate on new projects!

## About This Project

This site was created using semantic HTML, vanilla CSS, and
as of this commit - zero JavaScript. It was created using the mobile-first
methodology with an equal commitment to current ARIA web accessibility standards.

### Focus

The goal of this site is to keep it as lightweight and accessible as possible. No fancy frameworks or SPAs here, even though I love using those technologies when appropriate. This site was built using:

- Mobile First Methodology
- Pixel Perfect Design Implementation
- Semantic naming conventions
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
