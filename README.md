## Technologies Used
This site was created using semantic HTML, vanilla CSS, and
as of this commit - zero JavaScript. It was created using the mobile-first
methodology with an equal commitment to current ARIA web accessibility standards.

# Methadology
The goal of this site is to keep it as lightweight and accessible as possible. No fancy frameworks or SPAs here, even though I love using those technologies.
